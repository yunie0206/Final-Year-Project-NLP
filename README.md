# Final-Year-Project-NLP
The file fypcodes_v6.ipynb are the actual codes for the project.

How to use:
1. User to input website's URL into search system
2. The system will scrape the news article from the given URL
3. The system will then produce 'true/false' prediction
4. In some cases, the system will predict a 'false positive' prediction which will overide the original prediction

Example of website URLs used in video demonstration:
 •	https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-brewers-beer-65b7a7d4f2a2570c35a94b31572518af (trusted)
 •	https://nypost.com/2025/03/30/us-news/glam-wigmaker-accused-of-killing-mom-2-young-kids-in-horror-brooklyn-crash-charged-with-manslaughter/ (false)
 •	https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0y1py7ppo (false positive)
